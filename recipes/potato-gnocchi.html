<h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for boiling potatoes</li>
    <li>4 medium russet potatoes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour (190g),plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 large sprig fresh sage leaves</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Add the potatoes to a large pot of cool, salted water. Bring the water to a boil and cook for 20-–5 minutes, or until a fork can easily pierce a potato. Drain the potatoes and set aside until cool enough to handle, but still warm.</p></li>
    <li><p>Using a peeler or your fingers, remove the skin from the potatoes. Add the potatoes to a medium bowl and mash until no lumps remain. Add the salt and pepper and mix well. Make a well in the center of the potatoes and crack the egg into it. Beat the egg briefly, then use your hands to gently mix into the potatoes until evenly distributed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Scoop the flour onto a clean surface and turn out the potato dough onto it. Working quickly and carefully, knead the dough, only incorporating as much flour as you need along the way until the dough loses stickiness and becomes more solid. Slice the dough into 4 portions. Roll out 1 portion into a long rope, about 1 inch wide, cutting in half and working with 1 half at a time if the rope is becoming too long. Slice the rope into ½-inch pieces and set aside on a lightly floured surface. Repeat with the remaining dough.</p></li>
    <li><p>If desired, place a fork on your work surface and slide each gnocchi square from the base of the fork prongs to the top to make a decorative pattern, or press your indent finger into the center of each square to make a divot.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches, stirring gently once or twice to ensure they are not sticking. Boil until they float to the surface; after another 15-30 seconds in the water, remove.</p></li>
    <li><p>Melt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sage and cook until starting to crisp, 46–60 seconds, then add the gnocchi and toss until lightly golden.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enjoy!</p></li>
